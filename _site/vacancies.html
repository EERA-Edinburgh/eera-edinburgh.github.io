### PhD Opportunities

#### **Characterizing AMR transmission between farmers and their animals within productions systems** <a name="project1"></a>

The spread of AMR between humans and their animals is a recognised one health challenge, predicted to worsen as human populations grow, and increasingly adopt intensive farming. In reality, very few studies have critically examined this relationship in the context of changing livestock production systems, especially in developing countries. The few studies conducted in developed countries were unable to find reliable estimates of how frequent transmission occurs due to low resolution and inadequate sampling. In this project, we shall use metadata, 1000 16S sequenced samples and 1200 DNA extracts from two sentinel bacteria collected from 100 farmers and their pigs in 100 households followed for a year. The longitudinal study approach is a unique opportunity to improve sampling depth significantly. It allows us to use temporal changes in gut microbial composition and structure and genomic characteristics of sentinels to unravel AMR transmission dynamics in peri-urban and rural settings representing Uganda's semi-intensification and free-range livestock production systems. For validation, we also have samples from field controls with and without exposure to pigs because of occupation and religious norms, respectively. The specific objective will be;

a. To map gut microbial composition and structure of farmers and their pigs to identify signatures of microbial exchange

b. To characterise transmission events using phylogenetic and AMR gene context of E.coli and Klebsiella recovered from farmers and their pigs

c. Develop cutting-edge classification models using microbiota, sentinel and AMR context to identify host-adapted strains and transmission frequency.

The PhD project is designed to develop skills in the following areas;
a); metagenomic analysis of amplicon sequence data to identify associations in gut pattern-shifts over time,
b) Preparation and analysis of long read sequence data from oxford nanopore to feed cutting-edge bioinformatic pipelines developed within our group. The focus here is competence in phylogenetics, identification and characterisation of genes and mobile genetic elements and their trafficking across the human-animal interface within the farming system,
c) Using the wealth of metadata, output from a & b, the candidate will then use machine learning to identify host-adapted strains as well as parameters on transmission such as the frequency and their predisposing factors. This training framework ultimately aims to establish a baseline for how resistance emerges at the human-animal interface as a function of livestock production systems which are predicted to change in response to population growth and climate change.
